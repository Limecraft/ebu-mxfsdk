bmx TODO Features
-----------------

(list is in no particular order)


1. add support for general purpose user and application tags, similar to
AAF/Avid TaggedValues

2. add support for reading MXF files that have no index table

3. add support for KLV raw essence input. This allows MXF files to be
treated as raw essence, e.g. is useful if it doesn't have an index table

4. add support for edit-while-record Avid MXF flavour

5. add OP label info to mxf2raw -i output

7. add essence group detection (e.g. DV, MPEG-2, MJPEG, VC3) to provide more
info than "unknown essence". Supports apps where specific essence type
info is not required, e.g. FFmpeg decoder

8. determine clip/frame wrapping type by analyzing the file structure

9. read and display material package timecode in avidmxfinfo

10. add general support for setting track id and numbers for material packages.
Setting output track numbers is currently supported, but not setting track ids.

11. add general support for setting track id and numbers for physical source
packages. Particulary useful if need to match the ids from an existing source
package when supporting Avid source file relinking

12. h264dump: remove need to buffer the complete NAL unit. This will also serve
to help start implementing a parser in the bmx library

13. implement more complete h264 / AVCI essence parser in bmx library

14. need to investigate whether Avid supports multiple marks per position

15. might be worth raising the gcc warning level to catch potential errors and
catch warnings that Visual C++ would emit

16. maybe better to drop the autoconf test framework and instead go with
a native test script. This would also allow easier implementation of specialised
tests

17. implement setting track number in the Wave writer

18. add support for multi-channel raw pcm input in raw2bmx

19. add option to disable audio inputs, or more generally, add ability to map
audio inputs to audio outputs

20. add support for clip-wrapped audio in the OP-1A writer

21. investigate I/O performance for frame wrapped essence reading. Might be
better to read a content package in a single read

22. investigate performance improvements resulting from avoiding copies and
using data buffer array structures

23. investigate support for non-zero start position in Avid clips, e.g. this
was found in Avid generated files when creating a sub-clip of an XDCAM clip.

24. cleanup commandline usage texts. Limit commandline usage widths to 80
chars.

25. investigate improving / cleaning-up libMXF file structure, particularly to
help writing wrappers

26. use the memory file output in more writers to ensure external readers
always see complete header partitions

27. factorize common code in bmxtranswrap and raw2bmx

28. add frame rate information to the Frame class so that the positions / num
samples can be interpreted correctly with local information

29. add requested num samples for Frame class so that client knows that
there are less samples than requested without having to remember this elsewhere

30. reduce the number of regression tests if some are redundant / equivalent to
other tests

31. add Avid uncompressed 10-bit / v210 / 16-bit YUV / v216 conversion
functions

32. optimize index table reading to avoid realloc and use linked list instead

33. add option to set the start timecode in the OP-1A file source package. The
material package start timecode could default to the file source package
timecode

34. add display dimension parsing to MPEG-2 video essence parser

35. add general purpose GetTrack/ClipInfo methods and data structures similar
to MXFTrackInfo when writing a file

36. support sound quantization other than 16 and 24-bit in apps

37. optimize searches in MXF essence reading by using STL algorithms for
example

38. implement support for reading and storing dark metadata

39. add option to write audio at video frame rate in clip wrapped file

40. add support for XDCAM overcrank files

41. add WAVE output option to mxf2raw

42. add WAVE input option to bmxtranswrap

43. add metadata-only mode to MXFReader and mxf2raw

44. allow partition selection in MXFReader and mxf2raw

45. support reading growing MXF files

46. add support for Sony XDCAM OP-1A flavour

47. add support for an OP-1A flavour that is Avid AMA link compatible
