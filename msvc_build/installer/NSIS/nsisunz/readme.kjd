This is a further reduced build by removing CRT dependency with Win32 calls.
It is barely tested, so use with caution; ie I may have introduced bugs.  
The uncompressed plugin is now 40KB instead of 80KB; compresses via UPX down to 22KB.

Changes from original realeas:
Added miniclib (from untgz plugin but with strstr() added) & adjusted files to use it.
Updated zlib from 1.1.3 to 1.2.2; except unzip.c/.h
Note: zlib is adjusted to use miniclib (ie direct Win32 calls) and not standard release.
Updated MSVC6 project files to reflect above changes (VC7 ones out of date!).
